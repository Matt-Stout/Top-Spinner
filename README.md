# Top-Spinner
Create a 3D hierarchical modal using TWGL transformations

This was a program assignment for CS 559: Computer Graphics

There are three sliders that control animation of the object.
- The top slider allows you to rotate the object about the y-axis
- The middle slider allows you to rotate the top-spinner one direction while rotating the attached propeller in the opposite direction, both rotating about the y-axis.
- The bottom slider allows you to zoom in and out, making the object appear larger or smaller, closer or farther away.
